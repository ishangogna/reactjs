You can use the 'react-router-dom' module for setting up routing.

1. You have to extract destructure BrowserRoute and Route from react-router-dom by : 
    import {BrowserRouter, Route} from 'react-router-dom';

2. enclose the div = app  in <BrowserRoute> and </BrowserRoute> tags to let react know u wanna setup routing.
    <BrowserRouter>
        <div id = 'app'>
        </div>
    </BrowserRouter>

3. Add routes. Make sure to use 'exact' keyword since by default, react doesnt compare exact, but rather checks if that string is present.
    <BrowserRouter>
    <div id = 'app'>
        <Navbar /> -- fixed element will be present on all routes.
        <Route exact path = '/' component = 'Home' /> --Home will  get loaded under Navbar on / path.
        <Route exact path = '/Contact' component = 'Contact' /> --Contact will  get loaded under Navbar on / path.   
    </div>
    </BrowserRouter>
